          <h1>What is tolerance?</h1>
          <p>Tolerance is the appreciation of diversity and the ability to live and let others live. It is the ability to exercise a fair and objective attitude towards those whose opinions, practices, religion, nationality, and so on differ from one's own. As William Ury notes, "tolerance is not just agreeing with one another or remaining indifferent in the face of injustice, but rather showing respect for the essential humanity in every person."</p>

          <h1>Why Does Tolerance Matter?</h1>
          <p>It matters because tolerance is integral to different groups relating to one another in a respectful and understanding way. In cases where communities have been deeply entrenched in violent conflict, being tolerant helps the affected groups endure the pain of the past and resolve their differences. In Rwanda, the Hutus and the Tutsis have tolerated a reconciliation process, which has helped them to work through their anger and resentment towards one another.</p>

          <h1>How To Deal With Intolerance?</h1>
          <p>There are ways to promote tolerance and tolerating intolerance. As an Individual, you should practice tolerance by challenging stereotypes and assumptions in both social and professional settings. The media should promote cultural sensitivity by showcasing positive images, reducing faults between groups, especially for those with limited exposure to other cultures and little access to the outside world. The education system promote tolerance by creating inclusive environments, for example, schools that unite children from different cultures foster respect, understanding, and peaceful coexistence.</p>
